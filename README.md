# Objective:
## To construct secular determinants using a symbolic matrix between benzene and napthalene.

### MO-benzene-naphthalene.m
Determining the energies one a one ring to two ring structure of the molecular orbitals for 
pi orbitals using Huckel molecular orbital theory to demonstrate lowest and highest energies 

***Benzene and naphthalene are both aromatic except naphthalene has two rings whereas benzene has one.
Benzene is much more stable than other cyclic conjugation ststems with 4N+2 electrons. 
This determines benzene is much more useful to use as an unreactive hydrocarbon.***
